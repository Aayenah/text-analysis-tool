# Introduction
A Windows Forms Application that analyses a text file and stores unique words in an AVL Tree. This project was an assignment for a university module titled "Algorithms and Data Structures" for which I received 88/100.

# Core Functionality
- User browses and loads a text file into the program.
- The program will then read each word and store unique words into an AVL Tree (i.e no duplicate words stored).
- A Word has properties such as number of occurences, line number, line position and the string value of the word.
- The user can access any word and modify its properties or delete it.
- The user can add new words to the tree.
- Words can be sorted alphabetically or by the number of occurences.

# Known Flaws
- When a word gets deleted, the tree does not rebalance itself. After deleting a few words the tree will get unbalanced and inefficient.
- Search functionality is essentially done in a list which should be done using a tree.
- The program does not take advantage of efficient sorting algorithms such as QuickSort.


# Disclaimer
I would like to mention a couple of things here:
  1. This assignment was submitted in April 2020 and my skills have significantly increased since then. This does not reflect my current abilites.
  2. I plan to come back to this project and fix the issues mentioned. Feel free to contribute if you like.
